# solver.stokes_solver

Stokes-based pixel-wise stress inversion.

This module implements stress field recovery using normalized Stokes components computed from polarimetric measurements. This is the primary and recommended method for most photoelastic analysis tasks.

## Key Functions

- `compute_stokes_components()` - Calculate Stokes parameters from intensity measurements
- `compute_normalized_stokes()` - Normalize Stokes components for analysis
- `recover_stress_map_stokes()` - Main function for stress field recovery
- `predict_stokes()` - Forward model for validation
